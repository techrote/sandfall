title: Audited M11 baseline evidence
status: Current
scope: Immutable source identity, predecessor audit findings, M11 remediation record, and final validation summary retained for Git migration

implementation-state: Checkpoint and completion records are retained directly; machine-specific paths in the predecessor audit and validation command display are replaced by portable variables while original hashes remain recorded.

# Audited M11 baseline evidence

**Historical evidence scope.** Current status marks this evidence catalogue,
not validation of the active local revision. Each retained report/JSON keeps
its original date, results, and identities. For later Windows/Web work and
current source/backup checks, use the
[2026-09-08 audit](../2026-09-08-documentation-audit.md).

This directory records the exact evidence associated with source commit
`05ea45fda7bdd7b0150eb86c4922c202e89e08f4` and build ID
`m11-audit-remediation-render-handoff-water-native-repro-2026-08-28`.

| File | Purpose | SHA-256 before migration |
|---|---|---|
| `checkpoint.json` | Final M11 archive/source identity | `1f21b01e1c7870ed3c297dd51accebe1418f81459bc2ec56d161001b06deac9b` |
| `migration-source.json` | Machine-readable authoritative archive, build, audit, and validation state used for migration | generated from the verified final records |
| [github-migration-validation.md](github-migration-validation.md) | Clean-checkout, LFS, functional, and build-path evidence recorded before the private push | generated during migration |
| [m10-independent-audit-report.redacted.md](m10-independent-audit-report.redacted.md) | Independent findings that M11 remediated; only creator-machine paths and trailing Markdown whitespace were normalized | original: `87c7a3ee2f38713f9520221d929863d928f1499b79637db0839cdf3402de940c`; repository copy: `ac15871537c8ad9883d351fc7362cbbbcdb78ef1d6459df07d8bee27e09e8fc1` |

The original M11 workspace archive was 105,936,992 bytes with SHA-256
`6faa9c9020bb926088f76013f38c246026dc8e62aab7d33c1a10a1d411577b8b`.
The optional setup-cache v2 archive was 227,650,494 bytes with SHA-256
`b3824928ac59215a62211c19f4c5bef08e3eb4c79ca4e7c3839ac2dc3a49082c`.
Neither archive is stored in Git.

The retained result was 34 passed, 0 failed, 0 timed out, 0 skipped, and one
inconclusive LeakSanitizer run caused by the hosted environment. Windows runtime
execution and interactive GPU validation were not performed in this historical
audit. Later Windows/browser evidence is separately scoped in the linked current audit.

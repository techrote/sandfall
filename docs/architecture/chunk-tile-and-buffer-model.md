# Chunk, tile, and buffer model

## Why are there three different spatial sizes?

**Current native defaults:** storage allocation, activity elimination and
parallel work use independent units. Sources:
[WorldConfig/Chunk](../../native/include/cybersand/world.hpp),
[SchedulerGeometry](../../native/include/cybersand/scheduler_geometry.hpp) and
[World execution](../../native/src/world.cpp).

| Unit | Default | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| Storage chunk | 128×128 cells | Cell allocation, optional temperature, metadata and render dirty bounds |
| Activity block | 32×32 cells | Local wake, quiet tracking and eligibility; 16 blocks per default chunk |
| Scheduling core | 64×64 cells | Spatial job membership and one of four parity phases |
| Write domain | Core expanded by maximum rule radius | All cells a job may mutate; current catalogue requires at most radius two |
| Hard-terrain packet | 64×64 cells in the Godot demo | Rapier collider rebuild unit; separate from native scheduling |

Native coordinates are signed and sparse. The Godot adapter's 1024×1024 world
is a finite demo choice, not a limit inherent in native ChunkCoord. The desktop
GDScript fallback has its own finite arrays and **16×16** activity blocks.
That fallback geometry does not describe either native Web profile.

## How does a generation chunk relate to simulation geometry?

**Current GEN-001/GEN-002 source:** an opt-in
[`generation::Recipe`](../../native/include/cybersand/world_generation.hpp)
chooses the square output partition for a procedural proposal. Sampling uses
global coordinates, so requesting neighboring chunks in a different order or
partitioning the same region does not change its material proposals. Generation
neither runs the scheduler nor reads which neighbors happen to be resident.

Flow Network and District Grammar derive shared macrocell ports from seed and
global topology independently of output chunk size. Theme/brush changes cannot
change that topology parameter locally; modules run before the connective
skeleton is restored, while a final hard material override can intentionally
close a route. These are generated layout relationships, not simulation write
domains or new cellular transfer rules. The
[generation contract](../systems/procedural-world-generation.md) owns their
bounds/precedence; World admission separately requires its configured chunk
size and a previously absent destination.

Finite Hilbert/Morton tiles, aggregate grains, mask shapes and output chunks are
separate spatial partitions. GEN-002 addresses each from absolute coordinates
with signed floor division; changing output chunk size does not reset a field
tile or grain. Consecutive Hilbert ranks connect only within one finite tile,
while Morton ranks are not a continuous route. Neither substitutes for the
generator's macrocell port network or the simulation scheduler's write domains.
See the [field/curve contract](../systems/procedural-generation-fields-and-modifiers.md).

GEN-004 adds a finite authored window of canonical world-zero region addresses.
Its `region_size` defines semantic ownership independently of output chunks;
changing that grid size intentionally changes the semantic identity namespace.
A region-owned building can span many storage chunks. Neighboring regions
derive the same shared boundary socket without observing chunk residency, and
explicit passages and utility routes carry the cross-region connection. The
[hierarchy contract](../systems/procedural-hierarchical-generation.md) distinguishes
these finite plans from future persistent-world streaming.

## How are writes into a neighboring tile made safe?

With the Current native defaults, each job scans a 64×64 core and may write
within its core expanded by the catalogue maximum radius of two cells.
`SchedulerGeometry::phase` uses global core-coordinate parity. Same-phase
cores are separated enough that their expanded half-open write rectangles do
not share cells; geometry rejects a radius greater than half a core. World
also validates compatible chunk/core/activity alignment for its parallel path.
See [geometry implementation](../../native/src/scheduler_geometry.cpp).

`World::scan_rect` visits cells inside the core; an operation may touch the
expanded domain only within the enforced rule radius. Every affected cell must
be owned. Out-of-domain attempts are rejected by the operation's checks; they
are not automatically enqueued into a transfer system. Later visits may make
them eligible. General deferred boundary policies remain **Planned**.

The coordinator prepares structural storage before phase dispatch. Jobs mutate
cells in place and accumulate local effects; the barrier precedes deterministic
metadata merge. No next-state cell array or ordinary movement-transfer record
is needed for this backend. A storage or activity edge is not itself an extra
physics rule. Boundary fixtures must verify that geometry changes do not
introduce unintended seams; intended scan/phase order can still affect results.

## What is stored per cell and per chunk?

**Current source at `de332ea`, checked 2026-09-19:** `World::Chunk::Cell` aliases
[`detail::PrecisionStorage`](../../native/include/cybersand/precision_storage.hpp),
whose enforced physical size/alignment is **8/8 bytes**. It retains material identity,
material-local state and epoch through explicit masks/accessors. Default Water still
uses mass8/coherence12. Earlier four-byte prose and the stale World source comment
refer to a prior baseline; do not apply those storage costs to this source. This
source-scoped correction does not select a final production layout or reinterpret
#16/#17/#26 experimental controls. The [ordinary-sleep measurement](../operations/soliding-measurement.md)
records the actual carrier in its frozen artifact. Temperature is a
separate optional signed-16-bit array, allocated for a chunk only when needed.
Temperature storage exists; conduction is not implemented. Rule descriptors
declare bounded behavior in [material definitions](../../native/include/cybersand/material.hpp).

Activity and render dirtiness are distinct. Sleeping blocks eliminate rule
scans; dirty chunk bounds track needed visual publication and remain until
successful capture. The compact epoch prevents accidental repeated cell work
and incurs a full loaded-cell epoch clear on wrap. Normal sparse work claims
must account for that periodic exception. Detailed wake/sleep behavior belongs
in [activity tracking](../systems/activity-dirty-regions-and-waking.md).

## Are simulation tiles double buffered?

**Planned:** `SimulationBackend::Buffered` reserves a candidate name;
`World::tick` currently throws if selected. It is not a runnable rollback.
Executable alternatives are SerialInPlace and one-worker PhasedInPlace.

The retained design gives only active fields/regions isolated next/output
storage, uses read-only neighborhood views, then resolves cross-output effects
deterministically. Halo representation, transfer schema, conflict ordering and
capacity-recovery behavior remain unspecified. It cannot share mutable ownership
of a field with phased updates without a new explicit contract.

**Rejected:** full-world double buffering as the ordinary model, per-cell locks,
and a second competing liquid world. **Deferred:** alternative coarse-field or
hexagonal work experiments; local occupancy coarsening remains Rejected.
[ADR-002](../decisions/ADR-002-double-buffered-tile-jobs.md) explains the selection.

## Can these resources grow during play?

**Current:** native construction capacities and reservation methods are
explicit; lazy coordinator preparation may allocate during ticks. Preallocated
regions avoid the tracked chunk/temperature allocation classes. Workers do not
grow storage containers. **Approved:** a future drained transition can expand
capacity. **Planned:** live resize and general persistence; **Deferred:** broad
world streaming. Fixed-demo level saves provide none of these. Use
[capacity budgets](../operations/configuration-and-capacity-budgets.md),
[ownership](data-ownership-and-lifetimes.md) and the
[validation ledger](../reference/validation-evidence.md) before claiming a
particular region, allocation or boundary fixture is covered.

# Intermaterial interaction substrate

## Current boundary

INT-000 owns non-kinetic material/material semantics: conversions and products,
combustion/ignition/extinguishing, thermal/phase consequences, dissolution and
corrosion, cure/growth/special state, electrical consequences and authoritative
emissions/byproducts.

It does **not** own Water transport/head/leveling, density exchange, granular
support/bridging/bracing, erosion/entrainment, collision/ballistics, Rapier,
soliding, or scheduler semantics. Those systems may change whether contact occurs;
their identities are provenance/revalidation inputs rather than interaction rules.

Current source still has four distinct semantic classes: compact pair-contact
reactions; source-driven neighbourhood/context kernels; intrinsic/lifecycle state
transitions; and kinetic/contact physics outside INT-000 ownership. The permanent
substrate represents and inspects the first three without pretending the fourth is
an interaction rule.

## Schema and profile identity

The native authored source is native/include/cybersand/interaction_rules.hpp.

Current schema/profile:

- schema ID cybersand.interactions, version 1;
- profile ID int.current-behaviour, version 2 (version 1 was the 14-rule oracle
  catalogue; version 2 adds the MAT-002 building pass, 2026-10-18);
- tuning-pass root int.pass.current-oracle, version 1;
- tuning pass int.pass.mat002-building-materials, version 1, parent
  int.pass.current-oracle.

The source is sparse constexpr data plus a deterministic resolver. It is
human-reviewable and diffable. **Current since MAT-002:** the production resolver
first consults a derived 256-bit partner set per material, rebuilt at compile time
from `kPairInteractionRules` (`InteractionRules::build_partner_sets`/`may_pair`),
so non-reacting neighbours are rejected without scanning every rule. It is a
derived cache, never authored, and a native regression proves it agrees with the
authored linear scan for every material pair.

Stable independent channel IDs are thermal_phase, dissolution_corrosion,
chemical_conversion_products, combustion, electrical,
curing_growth_special_state, and authoritative_emissions_byproducts. A rule can
participate in more than one channel without replacing unrelated channels.

## Participant semantics and precedence

Current compact rules use **unordered matching with role-preserving effects**.
Reversing source/target therefore reverses role-specific products; it does not make
the effects symmetric.

The production Current pair resolver remains intentionally simple: explicit sparse
pair match, stored probability boundary, then role-specific products plus stable
rule/channel provenance. The authoring/compiler substrate additionally defines five
independent layer classes with fixed precedence: channel default < family default <
material adjustment < pair override < context modifier. Current behavior deliberately
authors **zero** implicit layer defaults/adjustments/modifiers; this proves the
infrastructure without fabricating semantics.

Ordered, symmetric and unordered-role-preserving pair matching are all explicit
schema choices and are covered by synthetic native regressions. Equal-precedence
matching layers are a validation conflict rather than "last write wins". Catalogue
validation also rejects duplicate rule identities, pair-override conflicts, invalid
family references and self-supersession.

Specialized neighbourhood/lifecycle entries are represented in the same profile
catalogue but remain authoritative in their existing world.cpp kernels unless a
later bounded migration proves exact separation from movement/contact code. This is
an explicit limitation, not a second authority.

## Explicit semantic families

Family membership is explicit and versioned. It is never inferred from material
name, MaterialState, density, appearance or themed construction naming.

The initial families make Current distinctions inspectable: bounded Combustible
kernel members; base Metal as the only conductive-base-metal member; base Glass as
the only reactive-base-glass member; and explicit hot-source, aqueous-contact,
biological-growth and special-agent sets.

Consequently Wrought Iron, Bronze, Copper, Steel variants, Copper Pipe and other
themed materials do not inherit base-Metal electrical semantics or the base
Acid+Metal compact Smoke/Rust pair override. This does **not** disable the existing
broad Acid neighbourhood-corrosion kernel; pair-override inheritance and generic
Acid behavior are distinct provenance paths. Stained/Chemical/Dark Glass do not
inherit base-Glass thermal pair semantics. Any later expansion is a versioned
tuning decision with fixtures/evidence.

## Compact pair migration

The retained INT-000 oracle contains 14 sparse compact reactions over IDs 0–80.
The corresponding prefix of `kPairInteractionRules` preserves their stable rule
IDs, products and probabilities.

The original migration preserved behavior. The retained native regression compares
the versioned resolver and public `MaterialRules::pair_reaction` API against a
literal pre-migration oracle over every pair of IDs 0–80, both orientations and
twelve probability-boundary samples. MAT-002's additional rules are checked
separately in both orientations across all 256 roll values. The public
MaterialRules API remains available to World and delegates to the versioned resolver.

The four-tick contact cadence, neighbour order/random salts, Water-state
initialization, worker ownership and writes remain World-owned; the resolver
selects semantics only.

MAT-001 / #158 changes that World-owned contact baseline: persistent compact pairs
retain their next temporal opportunity through activity sleep. The 14 authored
rules, products, probabilities and profile version remain unchanged. Source/runtime
identity distinguishes this scheduler repair from older contact evidence; the
[material contract](materials-and-rule-kernels.md#how-do-persistent-reactions-survive-sleep)
and [dated audit](../audits/2026-10-18-mat001-material-reaction-progress.md) own its scope.

## MAT-002 building-material pass

**Current (source, 2026-10-18):** `int.pass.mat002-building-materials` appends 42
role-preserving unordered pair rules after the 14 oracle rules
(`kCurrentOraclePairRuleCount`). Every rule involves at least one building
material (IDs 81+), and every partner (Fire, Lava, Water, Brine, Acid, Spark,
Steam, Salt, Molten Glass) was already an oracle pair participant. Therefore no
pre-existing material gains or loses its pair-participant flag. Rules pairing
those materials with new building materials are additive; every pair restricted
to IDs 0–80 keeps its frozen oracle result.

The pass covers thermal phase (kiln firing, glass and wax melting, snow melt and
quench), dissolution/corrosion (salt, gypsum, adobe, chalk, sugar glass, zinc,
bare iron), combustion (magnesium, sulfur, phosphor, sandbag, thermite) and
emissions. Exact rows live in the [building catalogue](building-material-catalogue.md).
Acid's broad neighbourhood kernel remains a competing authority for Acid
contacts. Seventeen building combustibles join `int.family.combustible-kernel`.
Probabilities are gameplay tuning, not calibrated rates; the coverage ledger
records the pass as accepted-with-limitation and the remaining building materials
as explicitly non-interacting. Evidence: the
[dated record](../audits/2026-10-18-material-fidelity-pass-2.md).

## Specialized Current mechanisms

kSpecializedInteractionRules gives stable IDs/provenance for Steam condensation,
Fire/Combustible, Gunpowder/Coal, Metal/Spark consequences, Cement cure, Molten
Glass cooling, Lava/Ice thermal contact, Acid broad corrosion, Cloner,
Plant/Fungus/Seed, Mite, Rocket state and Foam lifecycle.

These records identify current world.cpp authority and the non-kinetic semantics
represented. They do not duplicate runtime execution and do not absorb movement,
Water flow, granular motion or ballistics.

## Coverage ledger

Coverage is not an N-squared percentage. Authored status is separate from evidence
status and distinguishes inherited/default, explicitly non-interacting,
characterized/accepted, accepted with limitation, rejected, superseded, explicit
override and untested.

The initial ledger records the 14 compact overrides, represented specialized
mechanisms, Water+Sand as a non-INT transport control, themed metal/glass
non-inheritance and future tuning as untested. Later passes add sparse subjects
rather than meaningless Cartesian entries.

## Provenance and revalidation

Stable rule IDs carry channel membership, version/supersession fields, selected
tuning-pass identity, accounting notes and subsystem revalidation tags. Native
inspection exposes all seven channels for a queried pair, compact-pair
origin/selection, authored-layer match/conflict/effective origin, represented
specialized source/target mechanisms, selected-pass parent/disposition/change
declaration and a stable provenance chain.

Every schema-2 capture also records a rolling kinetic/contact baseline containing
source/runtime identity, transport hash, effective Water semantics/policy, fixed
execution/interest settings and worker count. That record is diagnostic provenance
only: INT-000 does not thereby own Water, granular, scheduler or ballistic physics.

A later Water, granular-contact, scheduler, thermal, biological or ballistic
change can identify affected evidence for re-screening. Old evidence remains under
its original identities.

## Materials Laboratory and generated fixtures

Schema-2 MicroScenarios remain the sole scenario/workbench apparatus. INT-000 does
not add scenario-specific physics callbacks.

Generated fixtures use complete definitions and therefore run unchanged through
the native-only runner, Materials Laboratory, fresh-reset A/B comparison and batch
evidence tooling. The proof set covers Water+Salt -> Brine, Water+Sand
non-interaction, Lava+Water, Fire+Gunpowder, Acid+Metal, Spark+Metal and
Cement+Water/air-context cure without adding scenario-specific material logic.

`tools/interactions/batch.py` retains the full stable-ID interaction catalogue,
rolling contact baseline, exact observations/source-sink ledger and semantic native
summary for one/four-worker runs. It fails the batch on worker-semantic drift,
reports coverage gaps explicitly, and compares two retained manifests at both
evidence level and stable rule/layer/pass field level. A changed catalogue entry
names the exact added/removed rule or changed parameter field; a difference is
evidence for review, not an automatic tuning verdict.

## Change discipline

Before switching additional production authority: characterize Current; represent
it; prove shadow equivalence; resolve every mismatch as migration defect; switch
one bounded semantic boundary; retain reference regressions; then update evidence
and retrieval routes. Every later accepted pass must preserve its parent evidence,
stable changed-rule/parameter identities and affected revalidation tags. Broad
material retuning is outside INT-000, and world.cpp must not be rewritten merely
for architectural uniformity.

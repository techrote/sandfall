# Transport profiles

## How are profiles resolved and applied?

**Current:** `CyberTransportProfiles` accepts version 1 JSON separately from
CYSD1, at most 64 KiB, with name, families, materials and pairs. Unknown keys,
fractional/nonfinite numbers, overlapping pairs, invalid IDs, malformed shapes
and unsupported versions are rejected. Baseline, Gentle transport and Threshold
erosion are protected constructors returning fresh copies; editing or saving
creates a user copy. Saved JSON uses `user://transport-profile.json`; the panel
also accepts pasted JSON and offers copy/export.

Resolution is schema defaults, family defaults, material adjustments, then sparse
pair overrides. Resistance belongs to the target grain; permeability belongs to
the liquid in either initiating direction. Mixing and carrying are directed source
settings. Pairs declare directed or symmetric; permeability overrides must be
symmetric, and lateral sampling/cadence remain material settings. The editor shows
effective values and origins. Only Water→Sand/Dust/Rust can enable carrying in
schema v1; other liquids remain disabled pending screening. Mercury retains
period 30 and disabled carrying.

Apply and restart validates before sending a copied candidate to the desktop
worker, or before the synchronous Web call. `CyberDemoBridge::build_tuned_world`
validates a fixed 39,529-int packet, constructs cells and render exchange, then
performs no-throw ownership swaps. Rejection preserves the old world/profile.
Jobs never parse JSON or mutate tables. Ordinary demo construction restores
production Baseline; lab reset retains the successfully applied profile. CYSD1
remains a level save, without tuning or complete replay state.

Resolved identity is SHA-256 of the lowercase hexadecimal representation of the
packed 32-bit integer bytes (little endian on Windows/Wasm). It includes version,
81 sampling values, 81 cadence values and 81×81 six-value pair records (IDs
0–80; later building IDs use defaults through bounds-safe accessors) in
source-major order. Native `state_hash` includes configuration; `content_hash`
continues to describe cells independently of the selected profile.

Source and runtime artifact identity are required alongside profile identity.
The [2026-09-10 Water relaxation change](../audits/2026-09-10-water-leveling.md)
keeps schema-1 values/hashes but increases lateral mass movement and optional
erosion pickups. Earlier Water traces and sampling measurements retain their
dated solver identity.

## What are the controls and units?

| Setting | Range and meaning |
|---|---|
| mixing | 0..255 fraction of successful powder-motion opportunities; 0 disables |
| carrying | 0..255 multiplier of successful Water mass transport, divided by 255 |
| pickup | 0..255 disturbance-unit threshold for a grain |
| packing | 0..32 additional disturbance units per occupied neighbour |
| erosion | 0 loose exposed grains; 1 permits exposed packed grains above threshold |
| permeability | 1..60 ticks, symmetric liquid/powder density-exchange eligibility |
| horizontal | 2 existing lateral candidates or 1 deterministic sampled candidate |
| cadence | 1..60 ticks between lateral opportunities, independent of strength |

Baseline uses mixing/carrying 0, pickup 64, packing 8, erosion 0, horizontal 2,
cadence 1, permeability 1 except Mercury 30. Experimental templates set powder
mixing 96 and Water→Sand/Dust/Rust carrying 255; Threshold erosion sets erosion 1
for these pairs. These are initial opt-in experiment values, not calibrated shear
or a replacement gameplay default.

## How does actual motion drive mixing and erosion?

**Current:** after a successful powder fall into Empty, `World::mix_after_motion`
may exchange it with an unlike exposed neighbouring powder, using a real void
above or below the candidate as loose-flow evidence and at most five occupied
neighbours. The source must actually have fallen vertically; activity flags and
update epochs cannot initiate mixing. The displaced candidate must not already
have been written this tick. Density eligibility remains a separate path and
still excludes every powder/powder pair. Identical powder grains are not shuffled.

Lateral Water movement/transfer may pick up the grain below its source. At least
64 successfully transported mass units are required, and effective disturbance
is `mass * carrying / 255`. It must reach both 64 and `pickup + occupied * packing`.
The eight-neighbour occupancy counts hard surfaces and support-capable grains.
Gentle rejects occupancy at least four; erosion permits it above threshold. A
coordinate-stable four-tick lane bounds pickup to at most one per source on that
lane. There is no stored disturbance, delayed transport debt or probability that
can gradually eat a resting bed. Once flow stops, pickup stops immediately.

Both paths use the existing whole-cell conservative swap, preserving material,
both state bytes and temperature, including Water fill. Each touched coordinate
is within radius two of the original update; writes remain within radius one.
The diagonal path includes the vacated/intermediate source, checks occupancy
and body masks, and cannot bypass a wall by checking only its destination.
Braced Stone remains excluded. The shared radius and job ownership are unchanged.

Telemetry kinds 8 and 9 count powder mixing and grain transport separately from
Empty movement, density swaps and conversions. Kind 11 counts new neighbour
reads. Existing histogram bounds/overflow apply; disabled hooks make no new
neighbour probes. No extra wake or per-cell motion field is introduced.
Horizontal sampling caps the existing lateral candidates at one; the first
direction uses the existing deterministic rule. Water and yielding liquids
previously attempted up to two; Oil, Acid and Lava already attempt at most one,
so setting two does not invent additional movement. Gravity and diagonal falling
are unchanged. Cadence 1..60 gates only lateral movement using coordinate-stable
phases and the existing earliest per-block wake deadline, without catch-up.
This can wake quiet blocked liquid at later eligible times; it is not a guaranteed
sleep or performance improvement. Chemistry/lifecycle cadence is untouched.
Telemetry kind 10 counts eligible lateral candidate probes (target byte is a
placeholder, not the encountered material); kind 4 counts Water mass units
transferred, not transfer calls. Sampling never multiplies carrying strength. See [dated results](../audits/2026-09-09-issue-13-transport.md); visual
acceptance and production performance are not implied by native counters.

## What are the ownership and storage bounds?

`TransportPair` is exactly six bytes: 6561 records, two 81-byte arrays and the
configured flag form fixed construction configuration (about 39 KiB). No per-cell
field, hot-loop allocation, material thread or enlarged rule radius is added.
Two World booleans cache whether any mixing/carrying pair is enabled.
Godot authoring dictionaries are outside tick-time allocation claims.
Desktop handoff serials remain monotonic when a replacement native snapshot
exchange restarts its own serials, preventing stale acknowledgements from
discarding a fresh full-world image.

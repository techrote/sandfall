# Incremental settled-block discovery

## First increment and limits

**Current opt-in native producer and journal:** [World](../../native/include/cybersand/world.hpp)
owns a disabled-by-default [bounded coordinator](../../native/include/cybersand/settled_world_discovery.hpp),
which feeds [SettledDiscovery](../../native/include/cybersand/settled_discovery.hpp)
from serialized owner hooks and classifies complete registered tiles. Cells remain the only material owner;
no scheduler skip, proxy, compaction, material rule or Rapier change is admitted.
A uniform tile is not a face-connected region and not a cohesion certificate.
Mixed states, holes and material boundaries must be explicit refusals of the
uniform-summary classification, never silently filled or averaged.

**Current opt-in connectivity:** when `settled_region_connectivity_enabled` is
explicitly enabled, each completed journal publication is copied into the bounded
[`SettledRegions`](../../native/include/cybersand/settled_regions.hpp) engine under
the serialized World owner. Region publication remains read-only: it neither skips
simulation work nor transfers cell/material ownership. Issue #64 replaces the earlier coarse facing-tile retirement with exact graph
incidence. Each accepted tile revision owns bounded local components and
revision-bound face runs; components own their incident cross-tile edges, while
typed tile-revision and absence-face dependencies point back to the exact active
build/publication subscribers that use them. A changed tile therefore retires
its own dependency subscribers and only the absence certificates or neighboring
publications that actually depend on newly resident/facing coverage. Blocked,
refused and capacity-unavailable tiles remain unknown and therefore cannot be
crossed by a complete publication.

The Stage 2 lifecycle received an independent review and focused transition tests
before this substrate was written. **Current:** #59 sizes journal and connectivity
backing from the effective runtime tile capacity rather than the compiled maximum:
journal/owner/key storage are `T`, region edge storage is `64T`, and
frontier/seen/member storage is `32T`; `C=1024`, `K=32`, `B=128` and
publication `P=4096` remain frozen. #64 adds runtime-sized typed dependency
storage `D=max(16T, frontier_capacity)` (therefore `32T` in the integrated
configuration), plus `2P+2` bounded generation-bearing subscriber headers.
These are observer resources only: saturation refuses connectivity publication
without changing authoritative World state. #60 adds construction-time bounded ordered
key/spatial indexes without hot resizing or per-operation allocation. Registration
rejects zero/oversized/overflowing bounds, duplicate/overlapping geometry where
required, and full capacity. Handles contain an externally unique nonzero
incarnation plus never-reused slot; there is no live reset. New registry
construction requires a fresh incarnation. This is a block observation ID, not
production region identity. Copy/move cloning is forbidden.

**Current producer integration:** chunk creation registers canonical nonoverlapping
subtiles through an array-backed height-bounded ordered index over canonical tile
keys. Resolved owners carry incarnation-qualified direct handles, so follow-on
operations do not repeat key lookup. The generic connectivity adapter separately
uses a bounded `32T` row-interval ordered index for arbitrary rectangle
overlap/containment and checked face mapping; canonical registration and face
discovery no longer scan unrelated resident tiles.

Issue #61 makes payload mutation delivery change-driven. Direct material/state/
temperature mutations resolve only their canonical owner and immediately advance its
independent journal revision. Native worker jobs write only fixed local report records;
the serialized owner reduces those reports in deterministic barrier order, preserves
the exact number of writes represented by a coalesced report, invalidates source and
destination endpoints for movement and Water transfer, and queues at most one deferred
payload service entry per affected tile. That deferred queue is fixed at `T`, allocated
with the coordinator, and performs local signal refresh before a tile may resume
journal scanning. Ordinary direct/worker payload invalidation therefore has no
discovery-wide resident scan and no hot allocation. If a worker cannot represent every
payload report, observation is fail-closed by a producer fence while authoritative
World state remains valid.

Issue #62 replaces the ordinary resident-wide activity/deadline refresh with bounded
parent-local witnesses plus one canonical due-tick/parent deadline index. Quiet
observer maintenance therefore does not enumerate every represented discovery tile
to rediscover unchanged activity/deadline state. Authoritative simulation still walks
its own activity metadata for scheduler/sleep semantics; #62 does not replace that
scheduler or reinterpret deadlines.

Issue #63 completes the frozen non-payload producer lane. Transient occupancy is
tracked as an exact per-tile count with a nonwrapping mask generation, so set/clear and
change-and-restore cannot collapse to one boolean observation. Pending explosions use
the #57 footprint `P = (R + 2) + maximum_rule_radius`; bounded canonical-key routing
increments/decrements exact per-tile pending counts, overlapping events retain
independent obligations, and newly registered coverage derives the count from the
bounded authoritative pending-event queue. Checked signed geometry failure or a
rectangle whose absent-address traversal would exceed the configured bound quarantines
observation without rejecting or rolling back authoritative simulation.

Requested and applied inclusion have separate nonwrapping epochs. Explicit region
requests reconcile bounded owner records only when a request changes; tick entry
advances the applied epoch even when request ABA restores the same geometric coverage.
The #62 parent-local activity/deadline path never recomputes these #63 signals.
Coverage is exposed explicitly as `NotResident`, `ResidentUntracked`,
`RegisteredUnknown`, `Ready`, `Excluded`, `Blocked`, `CapacityRefused` or
`Failed`. With connectivity enabled, new residency is registered graph-side as
unknown before journal payload registration, so a prior absence certificate is
revoked before newly resident payload can become consumer-visible. All added witness
fields live in the construction-reserved `T` owner records; no hot overflow container
was added. #64 remains separate in the graph-side incidence/reverse-retirement lane.

Local mask occupancy, accepted pending events, requested/applied inclusion, live
adhesion-policy fences, clear/move identity and failed-tick quarantine retain their
existing simulation semantics. A missing mutation witness still makes the producer
unsafe: the journal cannot detect an omitted hook. There is no
rest-age or observation-gap detector in this journal: a producer must clear
`witness_complete` on gaps; unchanged flags across elapsed time prove nothing.
Public registration still rejects exact duplicate bounds but permits overlaps.
The World-only unique-registration path is admitted because its canonical key index
and deterministic chunk/activity/subtile enumeration prove uniqueness first.

## Mutation and activity contract

Use an independent nonwrapping block revision, not render dirty rectangles that
publication can clear. Direct material/state/temperature edits and deterministic
post-barrier worker reports invalidate summaries. Change-and-restore still advances
the witness even when deferred tile service coalesces repeated writes; movement and
Water report both endpoints. Worker report loss is never treated as "no change": it
fences observation. #62 carries no-write keep-active and ordinary sleep/wake as
parent-local activity witnesses. Future interaction obligations are stored in a
bounded heap ordered by due tick then canonical parent identity, with at most one
current entry per parent, in-place earlier replacement/cancellation/consumption and
no stale tombstone accumulation. Overdue excluded obligations park explicitly and
re-enter already due; nonwrapping generation exhaustion fail-closes observation.
Active, pending-deadline, occupied, excluded and failed-world states cannot gain
discovery rest. Re-entry must revalidate through ordinary activity. No sleeping flag
alone authorizes representation replacement.

A resumable scan retains its starting revision and scratch only. Relevant edits
invalidate any old summary immediately; no partial result is publicly eligible.
Complete results publish only after the same revision and activity/exclusion
conditions survive final validation. Each scan/start/dequeue/finalization in `advance` consumes its declared budget.
Immediate payload invalidation performs bounded owner lookup plus constant journal
work outside the service budget. Repeated mutations to the same tile may coalesce only
their deferred service entry; their nonwrapping revision increments are retained.
Deferred payload signal refresh consumes explicit service units before journal scan
work. Canonical key registration/lookup is height-bounded ordered work; generic
rectangle registration performs at most 32 row-interval queries plus bounded face
mapping. Producer event volume, registration and metadata feed cost must be measured
separately. Work saturation may lag safely; dropped invalidations may never leave an
apparently valid summary.

## Capacity, identity and failure

Current block identity is caller-supplied unique incarnation plus a never-reused
slot. The substrate refuses revision exhaustion; it does not allocate/check a
global incarnation or slot generation. Production region generation allocation
is now implemented by the opt-in connectivity engine and refuses generation or
publication-serial exhaustion. Registration/queue capacity
outcomes preserve cell authority. No hot resize or hidden unbounded overflow
list. If observation integrity is lost, disable consumption of summaries and
report the reason until explicit observer/world reconstruction. **Current substrate:** explicit producer failure, source-read exception, backwards
valid clock or revision exhaustion disables every snapshot; the first failure
reason is retained. Stale handles and refused setup cannot advance the clock.
No in-place retry/reset exists. **Current World integration:** the tick catch calls
the observer failure boundary after worker drain; `clear()` constructs a fresh
nonwrapping incarnation; a World move transfers the observer and leaves no duplicate
identity. A block-local unhealthy signal is not used as a substitute for failed-World
quarantine.

## Passed Stage 3A reference and open Stage 3B gate

The [bounded connectivity layer](../../native/include/cybersand/settled_regions.hpp)
now receives exact complete tile revisions from the World journal and proves
four-neighbor exact-key local components, revision-bound face adjacency, resumable
complete-only publication, generation handles, holes, split/merge invalidation and
explicit capacity refusal in focused and integrated fixtures. Connectivity remains
separately opt-in and is compiled for at most 4096 tracked tiles with at most 32
local components per tile. Its fixed per-tile/component/frontier layout is deliberately
fail-closed but large. Focused/integrated correctness evidence plus exact-head
publication checkpoint `82e65f3` make this the passed Stage-3A bounded reference.
It has not passed
the Stage-3B large-world locality/memory/cost gate.

The connectivity engine retains append-only resident tile slots and fixed
boundary-cell neighbor maps. #59 removed the compile-maximum small-world backing:
effective-capacity storage now scales with `T` while the frozen per-tile and
publication limits above remain explicit. #60 replaces normal-path resident
registration/key/face scans with height-bounded canonical key lookup, a bounded
row-interval geometry index, direct owner handles and checked boundary mapping.
#64 replaces the Stage-3A global edge/dependency invalidation paths with bounded
generation-qualified local incidence: component→incident-edge lists,
revision-bound face runs, build/publication→typed dependency lists, and
tile/absence-target→subscriber reverse lists. Normal edge removal and traversal
now follow actual component incidence; revision/new-facing invalidation follows
actual subscribers rather than all resident publications or configured edge
capacity. Public generation retirement is immediate. Reverse-list reclamation is
registered separately and performed incrementally with generation checks so a
reused publication, subscriber, dependency or edge slot cannot be reached through
a stale ABA reference. #62 separately removes ordinary observer activity/deadline
resident polling through bounded indexed producer state; #63 still owns the remaining
mask/event/inclusion/coverage producer sparsification. The final
split/reconstruction/fair-reclamation scheduler remains #65. The earlier ~67.7 MB
compile-max measurement is retained only as historical Stage-3A negative scaling
evidence, not as a description of the current implementation.

It must quantify cell/block/chunk inspections, queue/scratch high water/refusal,
latency distribution, churn/false invalidation, region count/area, CPU and memory
per tracked area, and local edit wake/rebuild amplification on large worlds.
An explicit mixed-block refusal is safe but is not world-scale region discovery.

The first baseline/control and later A/B procedure belong to the
[measurement contract](../operations/soliding-measurement.md). Missing metrics
remain gaps; an observer's overhead is not evidence of an acceleration benefit.

**Measured integrated outcome:** the [276-process Stage-3 cost record](../audits/issue-12-2026-09-19/stage3-cost-results.md)
retains clean workers1/4 Current/producer/journal/connectivity comparisons. It finds
material fixed memory, producer metadata overhead and expensive large-region rebuilds
under sparse edits. These are cost-model results, not an acceleration or Stage-4
admission claim.

The parent-owned [Stage-3 review](../audits/issue-12-2026-09-19/stage3-exit-review.md)
maps every frozen checklist item to the integrated source, focused regressions and
capacity/refusal behavior. It classifies the reference as the passed Stage-3A bounded
checkpoint and keeps Stage 3B open. The next bounded step is the read-only
[Stage-3B Astra architecture review](../operations/soliding-stage3b-astra-review.md),
not a locality implementation or Stage-4 bake-off. Stage 4 is not admitted.

## Bounded work, fairness and metrics

**Current:** one budget unit covers starting/dequeuing a block, reading one cell,
or final revision/condition validation and publication. A 32-square uniform block
requires 1026 units. Empty/mixed blocks are fully inspected; holes, state differences
and temperature differences produce explicit classifications. Occupancy produces
Blocked. Noninspectable signals produce Blocked in one unit without a cell scan.
Only completed classifications are published as value copies; dirty work immediately
returns to Invalid, including ABA writes that restore the original tuple. The source
callback must be bounded, read-only, owner-serialized and non-reentrant.

Repeated invalidation of a partially scanned head rotates it to the tail in constant
work, so local churn cannot indefinitely starve untouched queued blocks. The first
outstanding dirty tick survives restarts. Queue high-water counts distinct registered
blocks and cannot exceed slot capacity. Full registration refuses only the new block;
there is no existing-summary eviction or lost invalidation.

Journal metrics distinguish signal observations, inspected cells, started blocks, budget work,
invalidations, restarts, all completed classifications (including Blocked), mixed/blocked
counts, registration refusals, queue high-water and first-dirty-to-classified maximum/
total tick latency. Counters saturate; identity/revision counters refuse exhaustion.
`storage_bytes()` includes the fixed records/queue, not a World or native heap estimate.
Connectivity separately records extraction, components, boundary comparisons,
adjacency, incident-edge visits/retirement, typed dependency allocation/high-water/
refusal, subscriber invalidation/reuse, absence subscriptions, deferred cleanup,
seed probes, traversal/validation/publication work, region area/count and latency.
`settled_region_storage_bytes()` reports bounded structural connectivity storage
for the configured runtime capacities; it is not a resident-set measurement.
No large-world distribution or real-hook CPU cost is inferred from these counters;
the registered campaign supplies those costs and its negative results define the
open Stage-3B work.

The [journal tests](../../native/tests/test_settled_discovery.cpp) exercise budgets,
partial publication, ABA, exact state/temperature boundaries, exclusion, pending events,
occupancy, capacity, failure, coordinates, fairness and copied-snapshot lifetime.
The [World producer tests](../../native/tests/test_settled_world_discovery.cpp)
exercise direct tuple/heat ABA, render independence, source/destination movement,
mask/event/inclusion/policy/reset/failure witnesses, canonical/custom/signed geometry,
no-write activity/deadlines, epoch wrap, capacity isolation, disabled controls and
workers1/4 parity. Integrated fixtures additionally cover exact two-tile publication,
split/merge generations, blocked-mask unknown boundaries, noncanonical Empty refusal,
producer-capacity/failure quarantine and new-facing-tile invalidation. They establish
this checkpoint's named paths. They support the passed Stage-3A bounded reference but do not supply
Stage-3B locality/scalability or current desktop/Web runtime acceptance.

## Synthetic journal cost preregistration (2026-09-19)

**Planned measurement, frozen before execution:** the standalone
[`settled_discovery.cpp`](../../native/bench/settled_discovery.cpp) cost decomposition
uses contiguous synthetic `DiscoveryCell` arrays, with explicitly supplied constant
inspectable signals. These are artificial input contracts, not observations of a
World, material stability or scheduler sleep. The reader only indexes immutable
source tuples during each service call; notified ABA edits occur between calls.

The matrix is sides **128, 512, 2048** cells, complete nonoverlapping **32x32** tiles,
fixed **4096** journal slots in every case, budgets **64, 1024, 8192** work units per
service epoch, and **7 sequential repeats**. A service epoch is one invocation of
`advance()`, not a simulation tick, frame, or duration of earned rest. Report actual
`sizeof(DiscoveryCell)`, fixed journal bytes and bytes per registered source cell.
The partially occupied registry intentionally exposes fixed-capacity memory cost.

Each run separately times source initialization, journal allocation/initialization
and all registration (including the current linear duplicate-bounds lookup, hence
quadratic total registration). It then records these fixed phases:

1. Initial full classification: drain the initial queue under the chosen budget.
2. Idle: **100000** service calls with no dirty notifications.
3. Local ABA: **128** repetitions of mutating and restoring one source tuple in the
   centre tile, notifying both changes, then draining that tile completely.
4. Churn/fairness: enqueue every tile, repeatedly notify centre-tile ABA before
   service, for `ceil(tile_count * 1026 / budget) + 4096` service epochs. Confirm
   every unaffected tile eventually publishes; preserve incomplete churning work.
5. Recovery: stop edits and drain the remaining queue under the same budget.

Report phase elapsed time and producer-call time separately, service epochs,
inspected cells, started blocks, work units, publications, invalidations, restarts,
first-dirty-to-classified total latency, lifetime maximum latency/queue high-water,
and pending queue counts. Producer timing includes clock sampling overhead and
source mutation/restore. Idle timing includes the harness service call. An explicit
extra registration at full4096 capacity must refuse; smaller cases do not pretend
to measure a full-registry refusal. Source tuples must finish exact, and initial
classification/idle/local work totals have deterministic analytical checks.

The driver [`run_settled_discovery.py`](../../tools/experiments/run_settled_discovery.py)
freezes copied source/header/driver inputs, tool and binary hashes, Git HEAD/local
status, hardware and this protocol before compilation/runs. It writes the complete
run plan before the first timed case, runs only sequential children, retains every
stdout/stderr/timeout/failure with hashes, and summarizes raw successful values
without dropping negative or ambiguous arms. Smoke overrides are labeled separately.

**Interpretation limits:** this measures the journal and synthetic array reader,
not real World hash lookups, native mutation hooks, activity/metadata passes,
component/connectivity work, collision rebuilds, Rapier or rendering. `advance()`
work excludes producer calls and registration. Low idle cost or bounded synthetic
latency cannot establish net savings versus Current sleep, a promotion threshold,
or Stage 3 completion. Churn overhead and fixed-capacity memory inefficiency are
results to retain, not reasons to enlarge fixtures until they disappear.

`Empty` means uniform material ID zero; it retains the exact state/temperature
tuple and does not authorize dropping hidden state or thermal storage. Direct
tuple tests cover this because Current content hashes alone omit some Empty state.

**Measured standalone outcome:** the [63-process journal cost record](../audits/issue-12-2026-09-19/journal-cost-results.md)
verifies initial/idle/local work and fair progress under repeated ABA notifications.
At 2048-square area it records roughly 29 ms initial synthetic scanning and a 491672-byte
fixed journal. Registration scaling, repeated churn work and incomplete churning
classification remain explicit negative results. The measured array reader excludes
real World producer/lookup/connectivity costs and does not satisfy the Stage 3 exit.

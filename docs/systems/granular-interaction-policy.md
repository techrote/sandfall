# Granular interaction and sampled player policy

## Which powders support the player?

**Current:** `MaterialRules::supports_granular_load` explicitly includes Sand,
Stone, Dust, Seed, Salt, Sodium, Gunpowder, Coal and Rust. Density and hard-surface
identity are independent. The native owner queries `World::granular_support_at`;
the interpreted owner mirrors it in `CyberInteractionPolicy`. The policy itself
does not create a Rapier collider, force or material ownership transfer. REM-002's
rectangle coupling consumes the same bounded predicate against **stored** material
to produce one cellular-owned bearing contribution; native cells remain material
authority and main-thread Rapier remains rigid-body motion/contact authority.

`InteractionPolicy` version 1 is immutable construction configuration. Downward
support counts a 3 by 3 neighbourhood at x-1..x+1, y..y+2, including the contact
cell. At least eight of nine samples must be hard terrain or support-capable
powder that did not move/change in the last cellular tick. The contact itself
must be a stable powder. Setup at tick zero permits immediate queries. This is
local packing, not proof of connectivity to the world floor. A thick distant
unsupported structure can temporarily satisfy the local approximation; cells
continue to fall and invalidate it as motion reaches the neighbourhood.

Side/upward resistance additionally requires all nine samples in the centred
3 by 3 neighbourhood. Loose grains and unsupported one-cell films therefore
do not become invisible walls. Hard terrain and the current body mask always
block. Excavation removes support on the next owner query, without cached
colliders or a sleep prerequisite. The bounded probe does not certify arbitrary
granular load paths. REM-002 now lets generic rectangle coupling use it only as a
local current-material load sample, with a separate capped yielding
impulse/correction; broad body↔granular acceptance remains REM-004 / #83.

## How does the sampled character move and recover?

`character_box_collides(origin, size, mode)` accepts finite positive boxes up to
32 by 32 physical cells (up to 33 by 33 raster cells at fractional origins).
Mode 0 checks full-volume enclosure, 1 samples powder at feet,
2 at sides, and 3 at the head; every mode checks hard occupancy throughout the
volume. Malformed/out-of-world boxes fail closed. `box_collides` is mode 0.
The old material-only fallback helper now identifies hard surfaces only.

`CyberSampledCharacter` uses at most one-cell movement increments, a one-cell
grounded step-up, and clamps each simulation delta to 0..0.1 seconds. PCHAR-001
now distinguishes two uses of the former enclosure search. **Invalid-spawn/reset
repair** remains an explicit bounded search of at most 128 axis candidates within
32 cells, nearest first and upward/left/right/down at equal distance. The
historical **sampled-baseline runtime** retains the same search before movement,
but records attempts, successes, last offset and cumulative upward relocation.
This instrumentation makes the previously implicit rapid upward-surfacing
mechanism directly observable.

The PCHAR **sampled-burial-safe** experiment disables that runtime search while
retaining explicit invalid-spawn repair. If material occupies the sampled actor
at runtime, velocity is zero, the actor remains in place with
`runtime_enclosed/recovery_blocked` set, and no material is erased or displaced.
This is an experimental disposition, not a new production player selection.
Diagonal escape, crush damage, barrel pushing and carrying remain unimplemented.

Native queries run only under the serialized World owner, outside kernels;
the read neighbourhood does not enlarge native job write domains. Desktop and
Web retain their different character/cell order. Fallback uses the same query
geometry and material capability, but its narrower cellular rules remain a
separate semantic reference, not native Water/reaction parity.

### REM-003 sampled-player landing response

**Current candidate C1:** the version-1 8/9 downward and 9/9 side/upward support
classification is unchanged. REM-003 source-matched characterization found that
packed standing, flat traversal, representative powders and excavation release
worked within their registered cases, while materially different Sand landing
speeds resolved to nearly the same rigid support height with no granular response.
C1 therefore changes the sampled-character response rather than retuning the
shared support predicate used by REM-002 generic body bearing.

On a downward sampled-player collision, impact speed below 24 cells/second causes
no disturbance. From 24 through less than 72, at most one supported foot-edge
grain may move; at 72 or above, at most two may move. Only the left/right contact
edge is considered. A candidate grain must be a stored support-capable granular
material that currently satisfies the existing packing/stability predicate.
It may move exactly one cell diagonally outward/up only through the existing
whole-cell conservative relocation path into real Empty storage not occupied by
another transient body. Material state and temperature move with the cell and
the normal wake/dirty machinery runs. Hard terrain anywhere in the sampled
collision volume fails this disturbance path closed; liquids, loose/unsupported
grains and ordinary resting contact likewise do not trigger it.

The player still stops on the accepted support surface; C1 does not introduce
character-owned material, a granular Rapier collider, a pressure/velocity field,
per-cell character physics or a second body-bearing solver. The native adapter and
fallback mirror the bounded operation under their existing serialized owners.
The resulting grain may subsequently move under ordinary cellular rules, so the
disturbance count is not a promise of permanent crater geometry. Broad generic
body↔granular acceptance remains REM-004 / #83. Owner gameplay acceptance of C1
is a separate REM-003 gate and is not implied by automated tests.

## PENV-001 player-side tuning input

**Current:** [player/environment profiles](player-environment-profiles-and-traversal.md)
leave this policy's support classification, PCHAR recovery policy and conservative
C1 relocation semantics unchanged. The sampled character supplies its existing
landing-response request as vertical impact speed multiplied by the active
profile's effective-mass and granular-sensitivity inputs. The exact-current
profile uses 1.0 for both, so the pre-PENV C1 request is reproduced.

Mass and granular sensitivity are deliberately separate tuning inputs; neither
changes gravity or terminal speed. Liquid response has a separately identified
profile field, but PENV-001 adds no Water response hook or generic-body semantic.
PCHAR representation selection remains separate: this profile governs the sampled
character and does not redefine the barrel/Rapier coupling path.

## How do pairs exchange, and how does Mercury keep progressing?

**Current version 1:** `MaterialRules::can_density_exchange` rejects every ordered
powder/powder pair. Grains rearrange by falling into real Empty cells, including
eligible downward diagonals. There is no density-driven exchange even in loose
powder; void movement supplies yield and avalanche. Existing Stone vertical-only
movement and native intact/granular bracing remain distinct.

The complete native liquid/powder classification uses the nine powder capabilities
above and these liquid IDs. It applies to either initiating endpoint before any
swap; density direction/target permission are still prerequisites.

| Liquid | Powder interaction after density eligibility |
|---|---|
| Water, Lava, Acid, Paste, Slush, Brine, Cement, Toxic Sludge, Molten Glass | One opportunity each simulated tick |
| Oil | Oil cannot initiate downward powder displacement; denser powder may settle through Oil |
| Mercury | One opportunity each 30 simulated ticks, independently of viscosity |

Native `World::exchange_permitted` also rejects displacement of an intact braced
Stone endpoint; explosion-created granular Stone (`state_b=1`) can yield. On an
eligible liquid/powder opportunity, a destination already written in that tick
cannot be reused. All downward/diagonal alternatives share the same modulo lane;
trying three directions cannot multiply the rate. Non-powder gas/liquid rules,
Water-to-Empty/Water mass transfer, lateral viscosity and chemistry retain their
own paths. Chemistry runs before the relevant transport and may change which
material pair remains; Seed germination and Water reactions are explicit examples.

Mercury uses `tick_index % period == 0`, with no random roll, coordinate-dependent
cooldown reset or accumulated debt. Empty movement is tested before this gate and
retains full speed. A denied eligible interaction stores the earliest due tick
in its source activity block. The ordinary metadata pass wakes due included
blocks; waiting blocks can sleep. Exclusion retains the deadline without motion.
Re-entry evaluates the present lane once, then waits for the next lane if needed;
it never replays missed moves. Failed-world quarantine still prevents tick entry;
clear/replacement abandons the deadline with its owning block.

The metadata adds one 64-bit deadline per native block (eight additional bytes in
the tested layout), with no new queue, allocation, full-world cell scan or worker
API call. Block ownership is unchanged. `state_hash` includes policy version,
thresholds, period and pending deadlines. This improves this state's identity;
CYSD1 still does not provide full replay continuation.

Fallback mirrors all nine powders, Mercury density/viscosity, empty movement,
powder-pair exclusion and the 30-tick lane. Its fixed deadline array wakes only
due included blocks and resets per-cell quiet counters within those blocks.
It has discrete Water, retained Slush density 1100, fewer liquid/reaction kernels
and no native Stone fracture-state representation. Other native-only liquids and
chemistry remain outside fallback parity. Gas displacement remains independent.

## Why these versioned settings?

[ADR-011](../decisions/ADR-011-granular-interaction-policy.md) selects version 1:
8/9 downward samples, 9/9 side samples and period 30. Diagnostic fresh construction
accepts `support_cells` 1..9 and `mercury_period` 1..60; invalid values preserve the
current adapter world. Normal reset restores defaults; the Tower offers validated transport profiles through an explicit restart,
while player-support samples remain construction-time diagnostic settings. The periods are ticks: 30 is 0.5 seconds
at the fixture's 60 Hz, and a different caller tick rate changes elapsed-time speed.

## Opt-in transport profiles

**Current:** the [profile contract](../systems/flow-transport-and-profiles.md)
owns schema, inheritance, units, immutable native tables and explicit owner restart.
The Tower applies validated profiles through restart. Actual powder falls and
lateral Water mass transport drive bounded optional mixing and grain pickup;
horizontal sampling and cadence are separate fixed experiments.
Ordinary gameplay keeps Baseline; chemistry cadence, compact cells and CYSD1
are unchanged. No unsynchronized live descriptor mutation is introduced.

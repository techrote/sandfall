# Themed construction material palette

**Current:** all 43 project-authored materials at IDs 38–80 are immovable hard
surfaces. Forty-one are inert; Oak Timber and Thatch can burn through the existing
combustible kernel. Their names and finishes do not imply distinct calibrated
mechanics, chemistry, or real holes.

This is the authoritative ID/role/finish reference for the
[secured checkpoint](../operations/source-checkpoint-and-recovery.md).
Sources are [MaterialRules descriptors](../../native/include/cybersand/material.hpp),
[World kernels](../../native/src/world.cpp), and
[appearance LUTs](../../godot/scripts/material_appearance_lut.gd).
Dated tests and visual limitations are in the [evidence ledger](../reference/validation-evidence.md).

## Native physics and scheduling

All rows above are `MaterialState::Solid`, valid byte IDs, exposed through the
C API, and included by `MaterialRules::is_hard_surface`. That common predicate
connects native character queries, geometry extraction, and Rapier terrain.

The 41 inert descriptors select `RuleKernel::None`, zero state, and write
radius zero. They have no scheduled rule progression. This does not mean an
active mixed core cannot scan their cells or that painting/rendering/collider
preparation is free.

Oak Timber and Thatch select the existing radius-one `Combustible` family.
Unlit burn state is inactive; ignition can activate burn progression. Fungus and
Mite recognize Oak as timber in their existing bounded substrate/feeding rules.
The desktop fallback treats these IDs as static surfaces and lacks that native
combustion behavior.

`is_hard_surface` covers the contiguous range from Limestone Block to
`kLastMaterial`, so the [building catalogue](building-material-catalogue.md)
(IDs 81–131) shares this collision classification.

Changes to hard-versus-non-hard occupancy update hard-surface revisions. Replacing
one inert hard material with another changes appearance but not collision
classification. Rapier rectangle count follows fragmented occupancy, not the
number of decorative material names in a contiguous wall.

The [material contract](materials-and-rule-kernels.md) owns cell layout, kernel
rules, and extension procedure. The [rigid-body contract](../architecture/rigid-body-and-cellular-coupling.md)
owns body/terrain coupling.

## Appearance boundaries

The finishes in the tables are presentation-only programs, with world-anchored
courses, seams, and grain. Timber/pipes currently read most clearly horizontally;
corrugation is vertical. Rough/hammered metals stay matte; smooth manufactured
surfaces can use restrained moving glints. Wet construction and glass finishes
are fixed in time (2026-10-18); neon and LED effects use presentation time.
Pipes, hazard stripes, insulation, cables, Oak Timber, corrugation, Stained
Glass, neon, brick, tile and reinforced concrete adapt to the shape of the run
they are painted in (orientation, cross-section, edges); see the
[appearance contract](material-appearance-and-rendering.md).
None changes physics or wakes cells.

Selected finish arithmetic is separate from the common four-neighbor relief
stage. Neither creates a second world image or per-cell light. Exact LUT,
projection, shader, glow, and full GPU upload semantics belong to the
[appearance contract](material-appearance-and-rendering.md).

## Limits and authoring

- Chainlink and Steel Grating are visually perforated but collide as solid cells.
  Author actual holes as Empty at useful scale.
- “Wet,” “rusted,” “chemical,” “metal,” and “glass” names often describe authored
  appearance. The reactive base materials and the decorative catalogue do not
  share every chemical rule.
- A cell stores one material identity. Substrate plus independent paint, moss,
  grime, or decal layers are **Planned**, not represented by these rows.
- Orientation/variant state and generalized authoring tools remain **Planned**.
  Do not add per-cell CPU state solely for visual variation without a measured
  need and an approved representation.
- Shader compilation and scene/browser observations do not replace representative
  GPU profiling or manual approval of every finish.

Castle, village, factory, and alley composition recipes belong to
[Material Lab](../MATERIAL_LAB.md#construction-recipes). These are suggested
arrangements of Current materials, not prebuilt production content or guarantees
of realistic material science.

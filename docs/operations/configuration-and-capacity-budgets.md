# Configuration and capacity budgets

The bounded [synchronous Water body constructor](../architecture/liquid-prepared-setup-and-receipts.md#synchronous-supported-body-water-feel)
reuses one native pending World/token, one permanent three-body private graph,
the existing terrain chunk/time budget, at least two frozen physics frames and
the20-second explicit readiness refusal. It adds no native capacity, tick-time
allocation, fallback or physics-law change. Native capacity outcomes and future
failed-world quarantine stay authoritative; no final platform acceptance follows.

**Current:** native World construction, region/temperature reservation, event
capacity, and snapshot slot/patch/byte limits exist. **Planned:** general saved
configuration and safe live pause/drain/resize/publish. Explicit capacity failure
does not mean a failed tick is rolled back atomically.

This page owns preparation and failure semantics. Exact values belong to the
[configuration reference](../reference/configuration-reference.md); identity and
executed checks belong to the [checkpoint](source-checkpoint-and-recovery.md)
and [evidence ledger](../reference/validation-evidence.md).

## What can be configured now?

[WorldConfig](../../native/include/cybersand/world.hpp) is a construction-time
value whose established fields are mirrored by versioned `cybersand_config_v2` in the
[C ABI](../../native/include/cybersand/c_api.h). It controls geometry, workers,
quiet thresholds, resident/active/planning capacities, and accepted explosions.
Godot's finite adapter overrides several standalone defaults. Auto chooses
workers when constructing a world; it does not resize a running pool.

The compiled granular policy is a native construction value; the C ABI keeps
its existing layout and uses policy defaults. Diagnostic adapter overrides build
a fresh candidate before replacement. There is no live setting or save field.

[RenderSnapshotExchange](../../native/include/cybersand/render_snapshot.hpp)
has separate mandatory slot, patch-per-slot, and byte-per-slot capacities.
The finite adapter chooses concrete values, but the general API supplies no
production defaults.

Capacity bounds allocated work/storage; it is not a permanent stored-world
dimension. Native lazy preparation can allocate chunks/temperature during a tick.
The Approved goal of allocation-free prepared ticks is narrower than a claim
that all current ticks and callers allocate nothing.

## Current preparation procedure

1. Identify backend, geometry, worker count, resident/active capacities and
   intended loaded/interest extents. Account for movement/write reach beyond
   scheduled cores, not only visible pixels.
2. Construct World with explicit limits. `initial_chunk_reserve` is a
   reservation hint, not the hard resident limit.
3. Call `reserve_region` for required chunks and
   `reserve_temperature_region` where temperature will be needed.
4. Construct snapshot storage for the intended publication policy, then
   populate/load before the normal tick loop.
5. Exercise boundary crossings and observe `TickStats::chunk_allocations`
   and `temperature_field_allocations`. Zero counts cover those World-owned
   allocations only.
6. Observe resident payload bytes, planned work, event acceptance, snapshot
   required bytes/patches and high-water, and explicit failures. Retain command,
   input, source/artifact, and platform evidence.

[Native fixtures](../../native/tests/test_world.cpp) test bounded construction,
preallocated movement, event queue limits, and snapshot pressure. They do not
implement or validate a live resize protocol.

## Explosion queue rejection and exhausted simulation space

**Current:** enqueueing too many explosions returns false; accepted events apply
at tick entry. Running out of resident or active simulation capacity throws and
may leave a partially advanced tick. Such a World is latched failed: subsequent
ticks, writes, reservation and publication are rejected until explicit clear or
replacement. Accepted events are never automatically replayed. Reserved space reduces allocation pressure;
lazy preparation may still allocate chunks or temperature fields. Adapter limits
differ from standalone WorldConfig defaults, and live resizing is **Planned**.
Avoiding hot tick allocation is an **Approved** requirement; the **Current**
zero-allocation evidence is limited to prepared fixtures and their World-owned
chunk/temperature counters, not every caller or allocation category.
The API-specific outcomes are:

| Boundary | Current outcome | Limitation |
|---|---|---|
| Invalid World construction | Throws before a usable World is returned | Constructor constraints are in `World::World` |
| Resident/active chunk or core capacity | Explicit exception | Work may already have mutated this tick; no atomic rollback guarantee |
| Explosion queue full/invalid request | Enqueue returns false | Caller must inspect acceptance |
| Snapshot slots unavailable | `Backpressure` | Dirty state retained |
| Snapshot patch/byte capacity insufficient | `CapacityExceeded`, exact requirements | Dirty state retained |
| Native Godot tick exception | Adapter reports false/error once and latches failure | Desktop/Web stop and retain last valid publication; reset/replacement required |
| Generalized command/transfer queue | **Planned** | No complete shared queue-pressure contract |

Sources: [World](../../native/src/world.cpp),
[snapshot publication](../../native/src/world.cpp), and
[native adapter](../../godot/native_extension/cyber_native_cell_world.cpp).
Core candidates are capacity-checked before deduplication, so the bound is not
simply the number of unique output jobs. The
[threading contract](../architecture/simulation-tick-and-threading.md) owns
desktop/Web tick-failure handling.

**Rejected as a future policy:** silently clipping requested regions, dropping
accepted commands/dirty state, or hiding hot growth as safe expansion.
These prohibitions are requirements, not a promise that every current failure
preserves a pre-tick snapshot.

## Approved reconfiguration requirements

[ADR-004](../decisions/ADR-004-interest-region-and-reconfiguration.md) approves
explicit serializable capacity and interest policy. **Planned implementation:**
diagnose requested/available capacity, reach a safe boundary, drain affected
workers and leased views, prepare replacement resources, preserve committed
state and pending commands, publish a complete valid state, then resume.

The API, pause/rejection behavior, failure recovery, serialization keys/migration,
and production memory/high-water thresholds remain open. Proposed 10%/20%
margins have unresolved per-side/total semantics; current presets are explicit
pixel pairs. Current region changes follow the separate
[pause/re-entry contract](../systems/world-storage-and-interest-region.md#interest-filtering-and-re-entry);
waking new coverage can exhaust existing candidate capacity (counted before
deduplication). That produces an explicit quarantined failure, not automatic
capacity growth or retry. Offscreen retained activity still counts toward active
chunk capacity. Region pause/resume does not implement live resize.

CYSD1 stores a fixed level and selected metadata, not complete WorldConfig or
replay state. Follow the [level-save contract](../reference/level-saves-and-replay.md).

## Future acceptance gate

A live-resize change needs near-capacity and over-capacity fixtures, current and
2× dimensions, explicit failed-transition behavior, preserved state and
unacknowledged dirtiness, no invalid worker/lease views, and measured allocation/
memory consequences. Declare whether “2×” means each dimension or total area.
Do not promote design requirements to Current on source presence alone.

## How are physics diagnostics bounded?

**Current:** the [measurement runbook](physics-characterisation.md) defines 256
histogram slots per scheduled-core scratch slot and 8,192 merged slots, allocated
only on opt-in World construction. Counter overflow is explicit and drops
observations. Body metrics use the current 64-body bound, with fixed scalar and
4-by-81 face/material counters. Copied cell observations are limited to 512 by
768 cells; fixture runs are bounded to 7,200 ticks and 512 cases per invocation.
Rapier application observations use six scalars per body.

Native tick and coupling timings, used slots, core/chunk high-water marks and
overflow are retained in the [dated baseline](../audits/2026-09-09-physics-characterisation.md).
Offline snapshots, retained traces and postprocessing costs are outside hot-loop
budgets. These measurements do not establish a production performance target.

## Sampled support query budget

[Granular policy](../systems/granular-interaction-policy.md) bounds native queries
to 32 by 32 physical boxes (at most 33 by 33 raster cells at fractional origins),
at most 20 stable-material samples per contact and 128
enclosure candidates. Native queries allocate no storage; no worker read/write
domain or Rapier shape is added.

Delayed exchange adds one 64-bit deadline per native activity block, eight extra
bytes in the tested layout. It reuses the existing metadata pass and exclusive
block ownership; no queue or tick allocation is added. Fallback uses a fixed
PackedInt64Array and resets quiet counters only inside due included 16 by 16
blocks. This is bounded local waking, not a new whole-world cell scan. Existing
World preparation/allocation and failed-tick limits still apply.


## Issue #13 experiment checkpoint

The [tower](experiment-tower.md) reuses native validated recipe construction and whole-world installation. Commands are copied outside ticks; the latest pending control replaces the previous pending control. It does not add an unbounded command queue or global floor simulation pass.


## Opt-in transport profiles

**Current:** the [profile contract](../systems/flow-transport-and-profiles.md)
owns schema, inheritance, units, immutable native tables and explicit owner restart.
The Tower applies validated profiles through restart. Actual powder falls and
lateral Water mass transport drive bounded optional mixing and grain pickup;
horizontal sampling and cadence are separate fixed experiments.
Ordinary gameplay keeps Baseline; chemistry cadence, compact cells and CYSD1
are unchanged. No unsynchronized live descriptor mutation is introduced.

## MicroScenario setup and observation budgets

**Current MS-000:** scenario setup is admitted only at fresh replacement, not in
native worker kernels. `CyberMicroScenarioContract` enforces finite recipe,
JSON, event and observation budgets before replacement. The [MicroScenario contract](microscenarios.md#versioned-definition-and-validation)
lists exact limits and timing semantics. Retained optional timing samples are
capped; overflow is reported as truncation, not silently presented as a full trace.

These are apparatus budgets, not larger native World capacities. Existing native
allocation, failed-world quarantine and general input-queue limitations remain.
Fixed fixture execution rejects live cadence/adhesion overrides; owner-policy
legacy scenarios still require their actual owner settings in comparisons.

## MicroScenario schema-2 presentation and work capture

[MS-001](microscenarios.md#schema-2-complete-apparatus-presentation-and-existing-field-inspection)
preserves all existing setup, event, observation, JSON and native capacities.
It admits at most 12 named in-world presentation regions; title/profile/baseline
labels are at most 128 characters, region labels 96 and instructions 4096. The
declared run window is 1..3600 ticks, with at most one existing step command awaiting
acknowledgement. A/B retains two bounded definitions and one capture per slot.
`cell_state` is exactly one cell. Optional host timings retain at most 3600 values;
work-counter aggregation has a fixed key set. No recurring native timer or new
material operation is added. Failed/absent native owners reject read queries;
reported capacities are actual runtime limits, not UI guesses or raised defaults.

# Current validation and retained M11 integrity

## Why did the old consistency check report hash mismatches?

The old checker compared today's source and binaries with the M11 hash table.
Later implementation changes necessarily differ. An unresolved LFS pointer also
differs from a materialized library. Neither comparison establishes corruption of
the historical record. **Rejected:** editing M11 hashes or suppressing integrity
errors to declare current success.

**Current:** [check_m11_consistency.py](../../tools/ci/check_m11_consistency.py)
verifies all 28 original [BUILD_ID](../BUILD_ID.md) source hashes against Git blobs
at audited commit `05ea45fda7bdd7b0150eb86c4922c202e89e08f4`. It additionally
verifies 18 retained records, including the original checker, against the
[retention manifest](../audits/m11-retention.json). Text uses canonical Git LF
bytes across Windows/Linux checkouts. Missing historical Git objects fail the
check; fetch complete history. The historical tag and original hashes stay intact.

`--compare-working-tree` explicitly requests the strict legacy comparison. It
still exits nonzero when current files differ; its output is diagnostic drift,
not the current release gate. The [dated reconciliation](../audits/2026-09-08-validation-reconciliation.md)
preserves the previous failures and explains their resolution.

## What validates current source and runtime identity?

**Current:** [check_repository.py](../../tools/ci/check_repository.py) validates
canonical documentation, approved dependency versions, required notices/bootstrap
files, committed LFS identities and the published Windows/Linux runtime source inputs.
[runtime-provenance.json](../../godot/addons/cybersand_native/runtime-provenance.json)
and [Linux provenance](../../godot/addons/cybersand_native/runtime-provenance.linux.json)
bind each library's SHA-256/size to canonical source input hashes and dated execution
evidence. Changing an input requires a rebuilt, tested and explicitly recorded
artifact. Identity alone never substitutes for execution.

A local source checkout may validate LFS pointer identity while reporting missing
payloads. CI and release hashing require `--require-materialized`; every required
runtime object must match its committed SHA-256 and size. Vendor runtime libraries retain their dependency provenance. Other platforms
are not certified by the Windows/Linux manifests or a successful LFS check.

The [player playground checkpoint](../audits/2026-10-20-player-control-playground.md)
changes native World and the adapter, so its material modes require a rebuilt
matching extension. Source presence, a successful Windows cross-build and an
executed Linux fixture are three distinct claims. The
[player checks](local-build-and-validation.md#player-playground-checks) and dated
audit record the actual scope; retained M11 records are unaffected and must not
be updated to describe these new controls.

### #65 recovery-era retained runtime checkpoint — 2026-09-22

PR #106's validated native/test source froze at
`8dfa779a561374a5693556f50def3e9666783a98`. Workflow/documentation-only
changes led to validated branch head
`2cef97763579bb3cee645d15a22d254c3210410b` with source tree
`f03efb6d5768ae39a30f633c863c8400b27f825a`.

REC-004 published source-matched retained runtimes from that unchanged source:

- Linux `libcybersand_native.linux.x86_64.so` SHA-256
  `35319c915dd6f309c94b9388c2929931817a2cb511afba2cb004b36a93e5b8f7`,
  1,612,480 bytes; these are the exact bytes exercised by all four Linux Godot
  regression shards in run `35726233644`.
- Windows `cybersand_native.windows.x86_64.dll` SHA-256
  `79d9f586c4097efc7757a3b0960b47a4f6ed8535f068e16e575e406fea99dbd2`,
  2,090,496 bytes; this is pinned cross-build evidence only, not Windows execution.

Publication run `35731243531` passed materialized repository validation and
`git lfs fsck`. Final PR-head and landed-main matrices then passed; see
[validation evidence](../reference/validation-evidence.md) and the
[final recovery audit](../audits/2026-09-24-cybersand-recovery-audit.md).
Later REC-007 changes are CI/docs policy only and do not alter these source-sensitive
native inputs.

```

The eight checker regressions deliberately corrupt records, historical inputs,
current source and binaries, and distinguish pointer identity from materialization.
They also verify that legitimate current evolution does not invalidate history.

## Which build and CI gates use each policy?

**Current:** native builders retain compiler, SCons and exact godot-cpp source
checks. M11 archive/output byte equality requires the explicit
`CYBERSAND_VERIFY_M11_OUTPUT=1` flag; an explicit historical check is never bypassed
by the existing toolchain-drift override. Normal current outputs are identified
and tested independently. M11 output constants and dependency locks are retained.
The existing local override can still bypass compiler/dirty-source checks; inspect
and record those inputs. It is not a reproducible-release attestation.

Documentation CI checks current identity, retained M11 integrity, checker failure
contracts and both retrieval sets. It checks out the pinned companion workspace
because canonical links cross the two repositories. Release hashing separates
current runtime/provenance manifests from historical records.

Required GDExtension CI builds Linux from current source. Its Linux job installs
the freshly built extension, checks the ABI floor, then runs every `test_*.gd`,
two profiles, project import and scene smoke using exact Godot 4.7. It retains
source/binary identity and logs. The earlier separate Godot workflow, which loaded
the retained M11 Linux binary and a fixed fixture list, is superseded; Git history
preserves it. The separate Windows cross-build is an opt-in portability check,
not a desktop release claim.

**Optional Windows portability workflow, 2026-11-01:** dispatch `gdextension.yml`
with `windows_portability=true` to run the separate Windows cross-build and
retained-runtime headless test. The harness checks the native input set,
committed LFS/provenance identity, exact case coverage and source drift. Neither
this desktop lane nor Linux execution substitutes for actual Web acceptance.
Linux graphical shards retain ownership of display-dependent pixel checks. See
[Windows retained-runtime execution](local-build-and-validation.md#windows-retained-runtime-execution)
and the [workflow disposition](../audits/2026-11-01-ci-rehabilitation.md#workflow-inventory-and-disposition).

The mainline product gate is the fresh source-matched compatibility-Web export
and real browser acceptance. Threaded Web remains a separate profile requiring
cross-origin isolation; the specification schedules full compatibility plus
threaded qualification in SF-M5. Do not describe a compatibility run as threaded.

The earlier Web producer/consumer toolchain conflict has been retired with its
obsolete demo workflows. Current source-matched compatibility-Web and browser
acceptance are covered by the [CI rehabilitation audit](../audits/2026-11-01-ci-rehabilitation.md).
Remaining local wrapper/export-template provenance and threaded release coverage
stay separate. No historical hash reconciliation settles those obligations.

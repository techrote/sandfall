# Issue 12 Stage 3B production implementation plan

## Current base and boundaries

Production decomposition is approved from `main`
`35d03001257e0e2a3f60fa7ce6c9f6774c93e9d7`, the same head inspected by the
read-only architecture reviews.

Issue #12 remains the programme parent. Stage 3A remains the untouched
correctness/control reference. Stage 4 remains blocked.

Issue #29 / PR #55 merged independently as
`910717aac101363ec2b1b89e4041a22bc9a97b97` while #57 was being prepared.
That merge changed interaction/material-rule, `native/tests/test_world.cpp` and
MicroScenario/workbench surfaces, but did not change `native/src/world.cpp`,
World event/discovery geometry or settled-discovery internals. Stage 3B observes
authoritative interaction mutations; it does not duplicate INT-000 semantics.
Recheck current ownership before the later central World producer handoffs.

## Live execution checkpoint — 2026-09-24

The recovery programme is complete through REC-007 and REC-008 records the final
audit. The inspected pre-REC-008 authoritative main is
`0405cdfe35a855e8287215a71d1165e3107fd1d6`.

#62, #63 and #64 are landed. #65 completed through PR #106 and merged as
`cdf0a0874d4732c41273e10d921bcd5feaac3e3c`. The accepted PR head was
`2fa4d2270662a0e60985b52253a7e9de8bf737ff`; frozen native/test source was
`8dfa779a561374a5693556f50def3e9666783a98`.

#65's final exact-head Documentation/provenance, Water apparatus, Native and
GDExtension/Godot runs all passed, and the same four gates passed again on landed
main. Dedicated soliding ASan+UBSan, TSan, shared-library and benchmark execution
are included in that evidence. Source-matched retained Linux/Windows runtimes were
published before final acceptance; Windows remains cross-build-only evidence.

Therefore **#66 is dependency-ready**. The serialized continuation is
`#66 -> #67 -> #68 -> #70`. #70 remains the registered campaign/parent-exit
package and does not self-admit Stage 3B. Stage 4 remains blocked.

The development-claims remediation programme is parallel authority, not a blanket
pause. #86 remains open for general completion/ownership/validation-premise
controls, and overlapping work must still inspect live ownership/write sets.

### Recovery-era checkpoint — 2026-09-21 (historical)

At that checkpoint main was `20337053911d28f985a3211b5cd7c8f70fd4d9b5`,
#65 / PR #106 was still the active join package, and exact-head sanitizer/runtime
publication gates remained open. The [final recovery audit](../audits/2026-09-24-cybersand-recovery-audit.md)
records how those blockers were resolved. This historical state is retained here
only to explain the transition; it is not current routing.

## Resolved #57 event/halo contract

Issue #57 originally inspected the event/discovery source at
`910717aac101363ec2b1b89e4041a22bc9a97b97` and revalidated the same facts
after merge-based reconciliation against current `main`
`17f01f729b41da0e0a635a279b6e72684422cdd4`. This resolves G-P4 for the later
#63 producer package without changing Stage-3A source or event physics.

For an accepted explosion with radius `R`:

- the authoritative **effect footprint** has maximum cell reach
  `E = R + 2`; execution may clear cells inside `R`, convert eligible Wall
  in the outer two-cell annulus to granular Stone, and set the centre to Fire.
  `collapse_strength = 0` or target/random conditions may make an individual
  event sparser, but `E` is the source-proven conservative maximum for the event
  kind. The event performs no temperature write;
- the configured **dependency halo** is the independent
  `r = maximum_rule_radius` rule/scheduler reach;
- the required **pending observation footprint** at acceptance is the inclusive
  axis-aligned box with half-extent
  `P = E + r = (R + 2) + r`.

Thus #63 must mark every tracked discovery tile intersecting
`[x-P, x+P] × [y-P, y+P]` pending before event execution. `R + r` is too
small when `r < 2`; `R + max(2, r)` fails to add the dependency halo beyond
the event's actual effect reach. The default `r = 2` previously hid the
distinction because current Stage-3A marks only `R + 2`.

The #63 implementation removes the former `R + 2` observer-only path.
`World::queue_explosion` retains authoritative event acceptance unchanged, then
constructs the checked observation footprint `P`; exact bounded tile witnesses carry
pending counts until drain. If `P` or its bounded witness traversal cannot be
represented, discovery is quarantined after acceptance while authoritative event
semantics remain untouched.

Implementation requirements for #63 are:

- use checked signed endpoint arithmetic for `P`; negative coordinates and
  discovery-tile/activity/chunk face and corner crossings use the same formula;
- never reject or alter an otherwise accepted authoritative event solely because
  discovery cannot represent/index the wider observation footprint;
- when `P` cannot be represented or local incidence capacity cannot preserve
  integrity, conservatively fence/refuse discovery, escalating to an
  observer-wide quarantine when necessary, until the event obligation drains;
- absent/resident-untracked coverage remains an observation state, not a reason
  to change event acceptance. Coverage registered before event drain must inherit
  pending state when it intersects `P`;
- overlapping events retain independent obligations; shared coverage clears only
  after every intersecting event drains, with no counter underflow/early clear;
- rejected events create no pending state;
- no deferred event kind other than `ExplosionCommand` exists at the inspected
  head. Any future kind needs its own source-proven effect footprint or a
  conservative fence.

The #63 regression matrix must cover default `r = 2`; the smaller
`r = 1` checked observation-geometry contract; a valid constructible larger
`r > 2`; minimum legal `R = 1`; rejected `R = 0`; face and corner
crossings; negative coordinates; overlapping events;
absent/untracked coverage registered before drain; acceptance-before-execution;
successful drain including a halo-only tile; rejected radius/capacity/
authoritative-endpoint events; and the case where authoritative `R + 2`
coordinates are representable but the wider observation expansion is not.
Retain the existing event-before-execution/drain and deferred-explosion physics
tests as existing evidence rather than duplicating them.

Implementation note: the current material catalogue has an active Rocket rule with
write radius 2, so `WorldConfig.maximum_rule_radius = 1` is rejected by the existing
World safety validation. The #57 `r = 1` formula case is therefore exercised through
the same checked production geometry helper used by World event observation; #63 does
not relax material-rule write-radius validation.

Evidence continuity for this decision is
`13a26b78b1ef4d6eafa5f2fc649c79976a2eb6ac` (preparatory briefing boundary)
through `35d03001257e0e2a3f60fa7ce6c9f6774c93e9d7` (architecture-review head):
the relevant Stage-3 native source/tests/bench were unchanged across that
interval, and intervening MS-001/CI integration was not a fresh Stage-3 timing
campaign. The Stage-3 native event/discovery source also remained unchanged
between the architecture-review head and the #57 inspected source head. Final
revalidation against `17f01f729b41da0e0a635a279b6e72684422cdd4` found that
intervening #58 changes are limited, for this contract, to discovery
retirement/reset lifecycle ordering; explosion acceptance/execution, the
`R + 2` event effect reach, independent `maximum_rule_radius` semantics and
the existing Stage-3A event observation footprint are unchanged. PR #75's
intervening change is CI routing only.

#65 is the join between the producer and graph lanes. #57 only gates the
event/coverage completion in #63. #69 is intentionally early and mostly parallel.

## Ownership and concurrency

### Central World producer lane

Issues #61, #62 and #63 are serialized under one integration owner because they
touch authoritative World mutation/tick/activity/event paths. Re-read current #29
before each handoff. Do not preserve a stale branch merely to avoid integrating
newly landed authority-preserving changes.

### Graph lane

Issue #64 should remain primarily inside settled-region graph/index internals and
may proceed in parallel with #61-#63 after #60 lands. It must converge with #63
before #65.

### Evidence lane

Issue #69 proceeds after #56 without candidate semantic changes. Its executable
preregistration contract is `tools/experiments/stage3b_validation.py`; the dated
[issue #69 evidence record](../audits/2026-09-19-issue-69-stage3b-validation.md)
records the fixture/schema inventory and qualification boundary. The final
campaign may use MS-001 only as supplemental integration evidence after exact
source/runtime identity is fixed.

### Historical branches

PR #23 remains Phase-0 evidence and is not a production base. It must not serialize
current Stage-3B work.

## Gates

| Gate | Closed by | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| G0 production authority | #56 | Stage-3B implementation routing is canonical |
| G-P4 event footprint | #57 | Sparse event observer semantics are explicit |
| G1 lifecycle safety | #58 / PR #72 merged | Reset/replacement cannot revive stale observation |
| G2 runtime sizing | #59 / PR #76 merged | Capacity-sized reference preserves Stage-3A semantics |
| G3 indexed geometry | #60 / PR #78 merged | Registration/lookup have bounded deterministic structure |
| G4 producer completeness | #61-#63 | Every frozen producer route is witnessed or safely fenced |
| G4 graph incidence | #64 | Exact local graph and reverse invalidation exist |
| G5 exact backend | #65 | Generic split/delete works before fast paths |
| G6 publication policy | #67 | Residual global fold or composable digest cost is explicit |
| G7 consumer contract | #68 | Local/blocked/global observation meanings are distinct |
| G8 evidence | #70 | Exact-head campaign ready for parent Stage-3B decision |

None of these gates admits Stage 4.

### Issue #63 non-payload producer checkpoint

PR #101 implements the remaining G4 producer slice after #62. The package owns only
mask/event/inclusion/coverage witness production: exact transient occupancy counts and
generations; #57 pending-event geometry and overlap counts; requested/applied
inclusion epochs; explicit coverage states; new-residency unknown notification before
payload registration; and conservative fail-closed fencing when local witness
integrity cannot be represented. #61 payload mutation delivery, #62 parent-local
activity/deadline state and #64 graph/reverse-retirement ownership remain separate.
Quiet unchanged worlds perform no #63 resident-wide signal polling. Source changes
require one final source-matched Linux/Windows GDExtension publication before merge.

### Issue #59/#60/#61/#62 producer checkpoint

Issue #59 completed on PR #76 and merged to authoritative `main`
`5d89be4488e5fec3bf37e40ac87601fb14f2989b`. The landed Stage-3A-equivalent
backing conversion sizes journal `T`, edges `64T`, frontier/seen/members
`32T`, and key/index storage by effective capacity while retaining
`C=1024`, `K=32`, `B=128` and publication `P=4096`.

G2 is closed. #60 subsequently merged through PR #78, and #61 subsequently
merged through PR #89 as
`db00e84e1b26b99f2816b6c1258d5dea97fc1fa1`. G3 is closed and the
payload-witness slice of G4 is landed. PR #97 implements the #62 producer slice
from current authority after reconciling landed #64. It replaces ordinary
observer-wide activity/deadline rediscovery with bounded parent-local activity
witnesses and one canonical due-tick/parent deadline index, including in-place
replace/cancel/consume, excluded-overdue parking and re-entry. Authoritative
simulation scheduler semantics are unchanged.

Source-matched publication run `35526661344` passed from source freeze
`b8fe9698ca2f7ae5f2473b4a975db1aad6487c52`. **Self-resolving merge rule:**
on any authoritative `main` containing PR #97, the #62 G4 activity/deadline
producer slice is closed and #63 becomes dependency-ready. Before that merge,
the final exact-head gates remain part of #62's completion boundary.

### Issue #64 graph-incidence checkpoint

#64 completed through PR #98 and merged as
`bb6f12a7845f7249d68693a277c934e5fef5561d` without editing the #62
World/coordinator write set. The landed package adds revision-bound face runs,
generation-qualified component incident-edge lists, typed build/publication
dependencies, dependency-target subscriber lists, bounded absence users, immediate
public-generation retirement and generation-safe deferred cleanup.

The acceptance regressions include actual subscriber-pool slot reuse under a new
generation, not merely publication-slot reuse. Normal invalidation and edge work
therefore follow actual component incidence/subscriber fanout; #65 still owns the
generic split/reconstruction/reclamation scheduler and #66/#67 retain fast-path and
digest work.

G4 graph incidence and the serialized #63 producer prerequisite are both closed on
current `main`. #65 is now the active join package; #66 remains blocked until #65
passes its source-matched runtime/provenance and final exact-head completion gates.

## Required ordering principles

- correctness/failure hardening before optimization;
- semantic-equivalent runtime sizing before capacity-policy changes;
- bounded index before locality claims;
- reverse incidence before local-retirement claims;
- generic exact reconstruction before any fast path;
- a fast path must differentially match #65 and fall back on ambiguity;
- local observations cannot make global benchmarks look faster by changing result type;
- final measurements require one coherent frozen authoritative source baseline.

## Validation programme

The final campaign preserves Current/discovery-off and untouched Stage 3A as
controls and includes the runtime-sized reference plus useful candidate
intermediate arms.

Fixtures must include genuine one-cell material/state/temperature edits; the old
8x8 local-edit and full-column bridge controls under their real definitions;
large connected topology, true bridge/non-bridge/split cases; absent/resident-
untracked/new-coverage cases; future/earlier/cancelled/excluded deadlines;
no-write activity; event/mask/inclusion ABA; local churn versus remote progress;
every important capacity/refusal mode; allocation-failure injection; deterministic
worker/allocation/insertion permutations; and reclamation/peak-memory cases.

Use workers 1 and 4, at least five sequential process repeats per paired final
campaign cell, preregistered balanced ordering, ASan/UBSan and feasible TSan.
Preserve failures, refusals, timeouts and incomplete jobs as evidence.

No numerical acceleration percentage is preregistered. The exit review must
address safety, producer locality, index locality, memory reconciliation, bounded
deletion/service, unrelated remote progress, publication honesty/locality and
evidence quality.

## Issue #69 registered campaign contract

The candidate-independent #69 apparatus freezes the experiment shape before the
final candidate exists.

- Arms are explicit for Current/discovery-off, untouched Stage 3A, runtime-sized
  Stage-3A-equivalent, optional sparse-producer/indexed-graph intermediates and the
  complete Stage-3B candidate. Missing arms are marked unavailable rather than
  silently dropped.
- The fixture catalogue has 168 versioned logical fixtures. Each carries a
  canonical declarative fixture-protocol hash binding exact geometry/generator
  parameters and operation schedule into every run/result provenance record.
  Historical `local-edit` remains an 8x8 patch and historical `bridge` remains
  a whole column; separate genuine one-cell tuple and topology fixtures carry an
  exact one-cell mutation contract.
- Workers are exactly 1 and 4. Drain-to-completion and fixed primitive budgets
  `1, 8, 64, 256, 1024` are registered. A whole-region loop is never counted as
  one primitive and the new primitive count is not equated to Stage-3A abstract
  work units.
- Paired drain cells and interruption-sensitive fixed-budget cells use five
  sequential process repeats. Correctness-only drain qualifications are single
  deterministic processes unless a pre-results amendment is registered.
- A fixed SHA-256 cell shuffle and balanced normal/reversed arm order are recorded.
  Final benchmark processes are sequential/uncontended and warm-up/qualification
  output remains separate.
- The default generated final plan has 6,488 run records. This is a deliberately
  bounded matrix rather than a wasteful Cartesian duplication of semantically
  meaningless Current/historical fixed-budget cases.
- Result schema v1 retains explicit success, correctness failure, refusal, timeout,
  source failure, failed-world, unavailable and not-applicable states plus exact
  source/compiler/runtime/hardware/order provenance. Slow performance remains a
  measurement, not a threshold-derived failure state.
- Reducer schema v1 preserves terminal states, high-water/refusal evidence and an
  exact provenance index; flags missing/insufficient samples; summarizes declared
  numeric metric populations directly; and encodes no candidate winner or universal
  percentage-speedup threshold.
- The #58 replacement-failure fixture uses retire-first lifecycle semantics: a
  failed replacement leaves discovery unavailable, does not mark the World failed,
  and a later successful clear creates a fresh observer incarnation.
- The #57 event-halo fixture binds the additive pending footprint
  `P = (R + 2) + maximum_rule_radius`; #63 retains implementation ownership for
  the sparse event/coverage producer.

#70 must freeze one authoritative simulation/material baseline, exact source/runtime
identity for every available arm, final capacities, compiler/artifact identity,
target host/OS/power mode and any interface-driven pre-results amendment before
executing the registered plan. Untouched historical Stage 3A remains a separately
identified reference series when it cannot share the matched authority.

## Immediate execution order

1. #56 authority/routing is complete.
2. #58 / PR #72 is complete and G1 is closed; #57 / PR #73 is complete and
   G-P4 is closed. #69 preregistration is complete; #70 remains gated on #68 and
   the frozen candidate/source-runtime identity.
3. #59 / PR #76 and #60 / PR #78 are complete; G2 and G3 are closed.
4. The serialized World-producer lane #61 -> #62 -> #63 is complete, and #64's
   separate graph lane is complete. Both halves of the #65 join are landed.
5. #65 / PR #106 is complete, source-matched and landed; do not reopen it merely
   to recreate recovery chronology.
6. Proceed #66 -> #67 -> #68 from current authoritative main, preserving #65 as
   the exact fallback/backend correctness contract.
7. Freeze one coherent candidate and execute #70.
8. Return #70 to the supervising parent. Do not self-admit Stage 3B.
